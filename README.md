## Overview

This original project that this app is based on was part of the WesBos JavaScript Course. I have made quite a few changes to the original app to practice skills I learnt during the course and beyond. The main changes I made were changing the API, adding a typing effect and adding a loader.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Request a new random beer
- Recieve a new random beer
- Also recieve a new beer related quote in the button text

### Built with

- JavaScript

### What I learned

I have learnt so many new skills and concepts during the build of this project. 
- DOM Manipulation
- Fetching data and displaying data from API's
- Events
- Async Functions
- Using Template Literals
- Set Timeout
- Math Methods


### Continued development

Moving forward I would like to continue learning about and experiment more with integrating data from API's. I would like to migrate some of my vanilla js projects into React projects to get more experience working with SPA's.
